            <h2>About Kilt</h2>
            <p>Kilt is a CMS that gets to the point.</p>
            <p>Define the types of content you want to show on your site, and Kilt will provide a clean admin system to manage them.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section" id="features">
          <h2>Features</h2>

          <h3>Fast content administration</h3>
          <p>After you install Kilt, you have a fully-functioning CMS.  Create a schema for each bit of content, and Kilt will create a page to manage it.</p>

          <h3>No migrations</h3>
          <p>
          Kilt stores all of its data in one table, with each record as JSON. Pure, raw JSON. You ask for data from the CMS, you get JSON back.
          </p>
          <p>
          If you want to change the shape of your data, just edit your schema in "config/kilt/config.yml". Your admin screens will adjust.
          </p>

          <h3>Your Rails app remains a Rails app</h3>
          <p>
          Kilt gives you a CMS, and that's it.  It doesn't turn your Rails app into a "Kilt app" like other CMS libraries.
          </p>

          <h3>Kilt is as easy to remove as it is to setup</h3>
          <p>
          Your data is pure JSON, your Kilt objects are defined in one schema file, and Kilt occupies very little of your codebase. 
          </p>
          <p>
          <i>This makes Kilt an idea prototyping system as well.</i>
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="section" id="installation">
          {% capture installation %}{% include installation.md %}{% endcapture %}
          {{ installation | markdownify }}
        </div>

<div class="section" id="usage">
  <h2>Usage</h2>
  <h3>Authentication</h3>

  <p>
    Of course, you need to protect access to your Kilt CMS section.  Kilt comes with Basic HTTP Authentication out-of-the-box, which can be controlled in the "auth" section of kilt/config/creds.yml:
  </p>

{% highlight yaml %}
auth:
  username: YOUR_USERNAME
  password: YOUR_PASSWORD
{% endhighlight %}

  <h3>S3 Storage</h3>

  <p>By default, Kilt will store all file uploads to public/uploads. This obviously won't work for deployed sites, so Kilt comes with Amazon S3 support out-of-the-box.</p>
  <p>If you would like to switch to S3, change the "storage" section of your config/kilt/config.yml to:</p>

{% highlight yaml %}
storage:
  strategy: s3
{% endhighlight %}

  <p>
    Provide your S3 credentials in the "s3" section of kilt/config/creds.yml:
  </p>

{% highlight yaml %}
s3:
  key: YOUR_S3_KEY
  secret: YOUR_S3_SECRET
  bucket: YOUR_S3_BUCKET
{% endhighlight %}
